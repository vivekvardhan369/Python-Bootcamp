Task that you need to submit before Monday !
You to have create your GitHub account! Write your explanation about 
Interpreted, dynamic typed language ,How many types of data,What is meant by type conversion? Why we need it? And methods to convert

=> Python Programming Language:
    Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. 
    Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.
=>  High level Programming Language:
    high-level languages are more abstracted and allow programmers to focus on solving problems at a higher level without getting into the nitty-gritty details of how the computer works internally.
=> Dynamically Typed:
    A dynamically typed language is a programming language where the data types of variables are determined at runtime, rather than being explicitly declared in the code. In 
    simpler terms, you don't have to tell the computer what type of data a variable will hold before you use it.
=> Interpreted Language :
    In simple terms, an interpreted language is a type of programming language where the code is directly executed by an interpreter, line by line, without the need for a 
    separate compilation step.
=>  Data-types on PYTHON:
    Integer (int): Integers are whole numbers without any decimal point. Ex: int =5
    Float (float): Floats represent real numbers with a decimal point. Ex: float=5.8
    String (str): Strings are sequences of characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols, enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes ("). Ex: str='hello world'
    Boolean (bool): Booleans represent truth values. They can be either True or False. Ex: boolean = True
